### Monitoring permafrost thaw at regional and continental scale

**Hightlight:** 
This [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.10.008) is the first to map retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs)—a type of abrupt permafrost thaw—on a near pan-Arctic scale using high-resolution (2 m) data. It developed an automated pipeline to process approximately 200 TB of data, combining feature extraction with deep learning to produce manageable results. Additionally, a crowdsourcing system was created to engage the broader community. Notably, a cluster of RTSs was identified in Greenland, a region where permafrost research remains limited.


I also contributed to multiple studies mapping abrupt permafrost thaw on the Tibetan Plateau, including Xia et al. ([2024](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024gl109616), [2022](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3875-2022)) and Huang et al. ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102399), [2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111534), [2018](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10122067)). Beyond abrupt thaw, I participated in projects using SAR and InSAR techniques to derive changes in active layer thickness and to understand the gradual thawing of permafrost from the surface downward ([Wig et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024ea003725); [Miller et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024ea003725); [Chen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022ea002453); [Parsekian et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13152876)). I have been deeply engaged in international collaborations focused on monitoring permafrost thaw ([Yang et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04372-7); [Nitze et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04372-7)).
