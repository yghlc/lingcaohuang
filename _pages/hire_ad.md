## Research Assistant for a Project on Remote Sensing of Permafrost

The Institute of Space and Earth Information Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is hiring a research assistant (RA) to work on a project titled: “Carbon release from abrupt thaw of frozen ground in the Arctic and its impacts on carbon neutrality” (The abstract is attached) funded by Hong Kong Research Grants Council from 2025 to 2027. 
The RA will (1) apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to identify thaw slumps from multi-source remote sensing data across the circumpolar regions, (2) estimate the volumetric changes due to permafrost thaw and the compounding carbon mobility, and (3) write reports or manuscripts. 

**Applicants should meet at least three of the following requirements:**
(i) a good university degree preferably in remote sensing, geodesy and surveying, geophysics, and computer science. Other majors will be considered as well; 
(ii) good communication skills in written and spoken English;
(iii) good interpersonal skill and proactive work attitude; can work independently and also in a team;
(iv) Experience in carbon estimation, deep learning, AI foundation models, programming (Python or others) , web development, or Linux is preferred;
(v) A self-motivated and enthusiastic professional in physical geography.

**What we offer:**
Appointment will initially be made on a contract basis for one year, commencing January or February 2025, and is renewable subject to performance, mutual agreement, and available funding. We will provide a welcoming working environment, cutting-edge computing resources, professional development and mentorship, and highly competitive salaries and benefits. The RA will closely work with Dr. Lingcao Huang (https://yghlc.github.io/lingcaohuang/) who is a research assistant professor at CUHK.

**How to apply:**
If you are interested in this position, please send your CV to [lingcaohuang@cuhk.edu.hk](mailto:lingcaohuang@cuhk.edu.hk) with the subject: 'RA14302324 + Your Name.' as soon as possible. Only shortlisted applicants will be contacted for a short interview. 
 <!-- two-page research statement, interview, and other documents (e.g. a reference letter and certificates). -->
<!-- Review of applications will start on November 30, 2024, but will continue until the position is filled.  -->

**Abstract of the project:**
Most ground in the Arctic is frozen for thousands of years and is starting to thaw at an alarming rate due to climate warming. Perennially frozen ground, also known as permafrost, underlays around 15% of the exposed land in the northern hemisphere and contains a significant amount of carbon from ancient plant and animal remains. Permafrost thawing can release the frozen carbon into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, which may amplify climate warming. However, the amount and rate of carbon release from permafrost thawing in the entire cold region are still unclear, even not represented in most Earth System Models, posting uncertainties and risks to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by the middle of this century.
The objectives of the proposed project are to quantify the amount of carbon release from abrupt thaw (AThaw) of permafrost such as retrogressive thaw slumps and active layer detachments in the Arctic and to assess the corresponding impacts on carbon neutrality. This project will use 2-m-posting elevation differences, multi-source remote sensing imagery, and artificial intelligence to identify regions of AThaw and use modeling to quantify the amount of carbon release. Specifically, we will (1) classify regions of elevation reductions (polygons obtained in the previous work) into AThaw-induced and non-AThaw-induced using deep-learning-based algorithms and satellite imagery, (2) calculate the volume changes of each AThaw using elevation differences and estimate the corresponding amount of carbon release using the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, and (3) assess the impacts of AThaw on carbon neutrality by comparing the AThaw carbon release with the carbon emissions from the Arctic countries and estimating reductions in emission budgets (the cumulative amount of anthropogenic carbon emission compatible with a global temperature change target).
The anticipated outcomes of this project include the spatial distribution of AThaw in the Arctic, the amount of AThaw carbon release during the investigating period (2008–2017), the estimation of reductions in carbon emission budgets, and the training of undergraduate and graduate students. This project will promote awareness and education about the critical role of permafrost in the context of carbon neutrality, fostering collaboration among researchers and policymakers. By achieving the goal of this project, we can reduce the uncertainties of calculating global carbon emissions and provide insightful and accurate references for building a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet.
