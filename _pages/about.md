<!---about my research and expertise--->
### Research: 
I use remote sensing to observe the changes on Earth's surface and try to understand the deriving factors by combining modeling and various data including topography, meteorology, and in-situ measurement, with a focus on the cold regions and coastal areas. 
The main motivation is to understand the impacts caused by anthropogenic climate change on the Earth's system and to provide data and calibration for future projection, which is crucial for building a sustainable society. 
Currently, I am working on mapping the abrupt thaw of perennially frozen ground (aka. permafrost) such as retrogressive thaw slumps at a continental scale, and analyzing the controlling factors for their initiation and evolution. 
Due to the small size of the abrupt thaw on satellite imagery and large-scale mapping, I use high-resolution ($leq$ 10 m) imagery, deep learning, and supercomputers to handle the big data in this task. 

<!--- especially  focusing on the frozen ground in Tibet and circumpolar regions. --->
